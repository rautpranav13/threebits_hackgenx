Team ThreeBits working on BMS.

<h3> Problem Statement: </h3> 
> Most buildings still rely on outdated systems that operate blindly, without considering real-time needs or occupancy.

> HVAC and lighting systems often run continuously, even when not required  leading to massive energy loss and increased carbon output.

> Traditional Building Management Systems (BMS) are often too costly or rigid, making them inaccessible for smaller or older infrastructures.

> There is a clear need for affordable, AI-enabled, real-time control systems that can bring intelligent energy optimization to every building.


<h3> Proposed Solution: </h3>
> An adaptable, end-to-end solution that turns conventional building systems into smart, AI-driven environments without needing a complete overhaul.

1] Seamless Data Fusion

> Smart gateways collect and unify inputs from various legacy systems (e.g., BACnet, Modbus, analog sensors).

> Real-time streams from temperature, light, occupancy, and air quality sensors are cleaned, aligned, and stored for insight-driven control.

2] AI-Powered Optimization Layer

> Smart gateways collect and unify inputs from various legacy systems (e.g., BACnet, Modbus, analog sensors).

> Real-time streams from temperature, light, occupancy, and air quality sensors are cleaned, aligned, and stored for insight-driven control.


3] Automated Control + Intuitive Insights
> A secure, cloud-connected control API relays optimized commands to building devices â€” like thermostats, variable drives, and lighting panels.

> A sleek, web-based dashboard allows facility managers to track real-time vs predicted energy savings, with override options for manual control.
